    "\n",
    "1. Acquire basic knowledge about Python and Matplotlib\n",
    "2. Gain familiarity with Juypter Notebooks\n",
    "3. Gain familiarity with the PySpark API and SparkSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve such goals, we will go through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In section 1, **IPython** and **Jupyter Notebooks** are introduced to help students understand the environment used to work on Data Science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In section 2, we briefly overview **Python** and its syntax. In addition, we cover **Matplotlib**, a very powerful library to plot figures in Python, which you can use for your Data Science projects. Finally, we introduce **Pandas**, a python library that is very helpful when working on Data Science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In section 3 we cover the **PySpark** and **SparkSQL** APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In section 4, we conclude the introductory laboratory with a simple use case.\n"

    "# 1. Python, IPython and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a high-level, dynamic, object-oriented programming language. It is a general purpose language, which is designed to be easy to use and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IPython** (Interactive Python) is orignally developed for Python. Now, it is a command shell for interactive computing supporting multiple programming languages. It offers rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history. IPython is based on an architecture that provides parallel and distributed computing. IPython enables parallel applications to be developed, executed, debugged and monitored interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebooks** are a web-based interactive computational environment for creating IPython notebooks. An IPython notebook is a JSON document containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text, mathematics, plots and rich media. Notebooks make data analysis easier to perform, understand and reproduce. All laboratories in this course are prepared as Notebooks. As you can see, in this Notebook, we can put text, images, hyperlinks, source code... The Notebooks can be converted to a number of open standard output formats (HTML, HTML presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python) through `File` -> `Download As` in the web interface. In addition, Jupyter manages the notebooks' versions through a `checkpoint` mechanism. You can create checkpoint anytime via `File -> Save and Checkpoint`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE on Checkpointing:** in this course, we use a peculiar environment to work. We don't have a Notebook server: instead, we creat on demand clusters with a Notebook front-end. Since your clusters are **emphemeral** (they are terminated after a pre-defined amount of time), checkpointing is of little use, for anything else than saving your notebook in your emphemeral environment. It is far better to download regularly your notebooks, and to push them to your git repository."

    "Spark is an alternative framework to Hadoop MapReduce, designed to make it easier and quicker to build and run distributed data manipulation algorithms. Spark comes with a library for machine learning (MLLib) and graph algorithms, and also supports real-time streaming and SQL syntax, via Spark Streaming and SparkSQL, respectively. Spark exposes the Spark programming model to Java, Scala, or Python. In Python, we use the PySpark API to interact with Spark.\n",

It is the program that declares the transformations and actions on RDDs of data and submits such requests to the cluster manager. Actually, the driver is the program that creates the `SparkContext`, connecting to a given cluster manager such as  Spark Master, YARN or others. The executors run user code, run computations and can cache data for your application. The `SparkContext` will create a job that is broken into stages. The stages are broken into tasks which are scheduled by the SparkContext on an executor.\n",

    "PySpark uses PySpark RDDs which  are just RDDs of Python objects: like Python lists, they can store objects with mixed types (actually all the objects are instances of `PyObject`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When PySpark is started, it also starts a JVM, which is accessible through a socket. PySpark uses `Py4J` to handle this communication. The JVM works as the actual Spark driver, and loads a `JavaSparkContext` that communicates with the Spark executors across the cluster. Python API calls to the Spark Context object are then **translated into Java API calls** to the JavaSparkContext. For example, the implementation of PySpark's `sc.textFile()` dispatches a call to the `.textFile` method of the `JavaSparkContext`, which ultimately communicates with the Spark executor JVMs to load the text data from HDFS. \n",

    "\n",
    "The Spark executors on the cluster start a Python interpreter for each core, with which they communicate data through a pipe when they need to execute user-code. A Python RDD in the local PySpark client corresponds to a `PythonRDD` object in the local JVM. The data associated with the RDD actually lives in the Spark JVMs as Java objects. For example, running `sc.textFile()` in the Python interpreter will call the `JavaSparkContexts` `textFile` method, which loads the data as Java String objects in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When an API call is made on the `PythonRDD`, any associated code (e.g., Python lambda function) **is serialized and distributed to the executors**. The data is then converted from Java objects to a Python-compatible representation (e.g., pickle objects) and streamed to executor-associated Python interpreters through a pipe. Any necessary Python processing is executed in the interpreter, and the resulting data is stored back as an RDD (as pickle objects by default) in the JVMs. \n"

    "In the example below, we are interested in the top-10 words in terms of frequency of occurrence. To do so, we use a small text file as an input, and we wish to plot the term frequency of such top-10 words using Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, using the method `textFile` from the SparkContext `sc`, we create a RDD of strings. Each string in the RDD is representative for a line in the text file. In a loose way, we can think the first RDD is a RDD of lines. \n",

    "Then, a `map` function transforms **each word** in the RDD into **a single** tuple with 2 components: the word itselft and the count of 1. As you might have guessed, this is a PairRDD, where each object is a key-value pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can take advantage of function `reduceByKey` to sum all frequencies of the same word. Now, each element in the RDD is in the form of: (word, total_frequency). To sort the words by frequency of occurrrence, we can use many approaches. One of the simplest approach is swap each tuple such that the frequency becomes the key, and use the `sortByKey` function."

    "# 4. Spark SQL and DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main features we suggest to use when analyzing data with Spark is `Spark SQL` - a module for structured data processing. Unlike the basic Spark RDD API, the interfaces provided by Spark SQL enriches Spark with more information about the structure of both the data and the computation being performed. Internally, this extra information is used to perform extra optimizations. There are several ways to interact with Spark SQL including SQL, the DataFrames API and the Datasets API. In this course, we mainly focus on `DataFrame API`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `DataFrame` is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. It is based on the data frame concept in R language or in Pandas. So, it is similar to a database table in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "`DataFrames` can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as: structured data files, tables in Hive, external databases, or existing RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the labs in this course, we will mainly work with CSV data files. So, in the next sections, we only focus on constructing dataframes from structured data files directly and from existing RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1. Constructing a DataFrame directly from structured data file\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct DataFrame from a structured file directly, the file type must be supported. Currently, Spark supports  csv, json, avro and many more.\n",
    "Among these types, the csv type is one of the most popular in data analytic. A DataFrame is constructed from csv files by using the package `spark-csv` from Databrick."

    "In this lecture, we gained familiarity with the Jupyter Notebook environment, the Python programming language and its modules. In particular, we covered the Python syntax, Numpy - the core library for scientific computing, Matplotlib - a module to plot graphs, Pandas - a data analysis module. Besides, we started to gain practical experience with PySpark and SparkSQL, using as an example a dataset concerning US flights."
